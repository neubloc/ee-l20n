This package is a fork of https://www.npmjs.com/package/l20n with a few fixes/changes
needed by the team at Laboratorium EE. In most cases you should just use the upstream
package.

L20n: Localization 2.0 [![Build Status][travisimage]][travislink]
=================================================================

[travisimage]: https://travis-ci.org/l20n/l20n.js.png?branch=master
[travislink]: https://travis-ci.org/l20n/l20n.js

L20n reinvents software localization. Users should be able to benefit from the 
entire expressive power of a natural language.  L20n keeps simple things 
simple, and at the same time makes complex things possible.


What L20n's syntax looks like
-----------------------------

A straight-forward example in English:

```php
<brandName "Firefox">
<about "About {{ brandName }}">
<preferences "{{ brandName }} Preferences">
```

And the same thing in Polish:

```php
<brandName {
  nominative: "Firefox",
  genitive: "Firefoksa",
  dative: "Firefoksowi",
  accusative: "Firefoksa",
  instrumental: "Firefoksem",
  locative: "Firefoksie"
}>
<about "O {{ brandName.locative }}">
<preferences "Preferencje {{ brandName.genitive }}">
```

syntax.


Localizing Web content with HTML Bindings
------------------------------------------

You can take advantage of HTML bindings to localize your HTML documents with 
L20n.  See [docs/html][] for documentation and examples.

[docs/html]: https://github.com/l20n/l20n.js/blob/master/docs/html.md


The JavaScript API and documentation
------------------------------------

L20n encloses localization into so-called contexts.  A context is an 
independent object with its own set of localization resources and available 
languages.  You can have more than one context at the same time.

```javascript
var ctx = L20n.getContext();
ctx.linkResource('./locales/strings.l20n');
ctx.requestLocales();
```

When you freeze the context by calling `requestLocales`, the resource files 
will be retrieved, parsed and compiled.  You can listen to the `ready` event 
(emitted by the `Context` instance when all the resources have been compiled) 
and use `ctx.getSync` and `ctx.getEntitySync` to get translations 
synchronously.

Alternatively, you can register callbacks to execute when the context is ready 
(or when globals change and translations need to be updated) with 
`ctx.localize`.

```javascript
ctx.localize(['hello', 'new'], function(l10n) {
  var node = document.querySelector('[data-l10n-id=hello]');
  node.textContent = l10n.entities.hello.value;
  node.classList.remove('hidden');
});
```

You can find the complete documentation for localizers, developers and 
contributors at the [Mozilla Developer Network][].  The original design 
documents can be found at the [Mozilla Wiki][].  We also use the wiki for 
release planning.
